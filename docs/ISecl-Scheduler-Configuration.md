## Configure kube-scheduler to establish communication with ISecl-scheduler.
ISecl Scheduler acts as a extended filter for Kubernetes base scheduler.

* Create a file called kube-scheduler-configuration.yml
```yaml
---
apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1beta2
kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration
clientConnection:
  kubeconfig: "/etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf"
profiles:
  - plugins:
      filter:
        enabled:
          - name: "NodePorts"
          - name: "NodeResourcesFit"
          - name: "VolumeBinding"
          - name: "NodeAffinity"
          - name: "NodeName"
      score:
        enabled:
          - name: "NodeResourcesBalancedAllocation"
            weight: 1
extenders:
  - urlPrefix: "https://127.0.0.1:30888/"
    filterVerb: "filter"
    weight: 5
    enableHTTPS: true
```

* Make directory /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions and copy kube-scheduler-configuration.yaml file into this newly created directory

* Add kube-scheduler-configuration.yml under kube-scheduler section /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml as mentioned below
```console
	spec:
          containers:
	  - command:
            - kube-scheduler
            - --config=/opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/kube-scheduler-configuration.yml
```

* Add mount path for isecl extended scheduler under container section /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml as mentioned below
```console
	containers:
		- mountPath: /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions
		name: extendedsched
		readOnly: true
```

* Add volume path for isecl extended scheduler under volumes section /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml as mentioned below
```console
	spec:
	volumes:
	- hostPath:
		path: /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions
		type: ""
		name: extendedsched
```

* Restart Kubelet which restart all the k8s services including kube base scheduler
```console
	systemctl restart kubelet
```
